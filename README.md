💻 Project Title: PassMG – Personal Password Manager Web App
🧭 Project Summary:

PassMG is a secure and user-friendly password manager web application built to help users store and manage their website credentials in one place. In today’s digital world, users often struggle to remember multiple passwords across various platforms. While browsers like Google Chrome provide built-in password managers, they are tied to specific accounts and devices.
PassMG solves this problem by offering an independent and encrypted platform where users can safely save, view, and manage all their passwords — accessible anytime, anywhere.

⚙️ Features:

🔐 Local Encrypted Storage: All passwords are securely stored in the browser using client-side encryption.

💾 Add, Edit & Delete Credentials: Easily manage your website URLs, usernames, and passwords.

👁️ Hide/Show Passwords: Toggle visibility for added privacy.

📋 One-Click Copy: Quickly copy your credentials for seamless logins.

📊 Password Dashboard: Displays all saved passwords in a clean, organized table.

🌓 Responsive Design: Works smoothly across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

🌈 Modern UI: Minimal, clean interface with smooth interactions and a developer-friendly theme.

💡 Unique Highlights (What Makes It Different):

⚡ Independent of Google or Browser: Unlike built-in managers, PassMG gives complete data control to users.

🔒 Client-Side Security: No data leaves the user’s system — ensuring total privacy.

🧠 Password Strength Visualization (Upcoming): Helps users identify weak or reused passwords.

☁️ Encrypted Backup & Restore (Planned): Users will be able to export/import passwords securely.

🔑 Vault Lock System (Planned): Master PIN or password-based vault unlock feature for extra protection.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Styling: Bootstrap / Custom CSS

Utilities: UUID for unique entries, React Toastify for notifications

Storage: Browser’s LocalStorage with encryption

🚀 Future Scope:

Implement AES-256 encryption for enhanced password safety.

Add password generator and health analytics (weak/reused password alerts).

Introduce cloud sync (Firebase/Supabase) for multi-device access.

Integrate biometric login using WebAuthn for secure vault access.

Develop a browser extension version for quick autofill.

🧑‍💻 Purpose:

To create a simple yet secure web solution that empowers users to manage their passwords independently, ensuring privacy, accessibility, and convenience without relying on third-party password managers.
